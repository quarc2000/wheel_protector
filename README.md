# Wheel Protector
A tool that during static tests protects the Scania Steering Wheel from a laptop or other equipment. It should fit the steering wheel from the year 2016.

* Only use in a static environment.
* Make sure there is no risk of detonating the airbag.
* Make sure the vehicle is not moving.
* Use at your own risk.

## Printing
As the two pieces are different I strongly recommend a colour separation between left and righ. I have standardised white to the left, and any other colour on the right.
I have mostly used PLA when printing, but if you are going to leave them in the cab they might quickly degrade because of the temperature, so PETG or even more robust materials should be considered.
There is very little load on the pieces, so 2-3 walls and 10-20 % infill shold be enough in most cases, but it depends on how you will be carrying them. I have been using them also as reflexes, 
using reflective string and reflexes on the sides, then having it connected to by bag with a carbine. But even then, no breaks, I think temperature is the biggest challenge.
It has of course been designed not to require any supports, making it easy to use any material (overhangs are insignificant).

## Mounting
The design is made to keep the two pieces together using a string. Earlier versions used glue to connect the string to the device, but to simplify production of several devices that was modified to instead using a separate lock piece
to lonk the string in. If you are using a thin string, you put a knot at the end and put that into the void before closing the slot with the locking piece, if you have a thicker string, you just melt the end a bit.
For low volumes you could of course still use a drop of superglue in the void before closing the locking piece.

### Further improvements
* As already mentioned you can make this also a security device during the dark times of year by making them reflective and carry them on the outside of your bag och backpack. Of course you would never work without a reflective west or other reflective clothing, but an add on is never wrong.
* You can see on the pictures I have also included a piece of a draft excluder. This is not necessary but makes the stability of the computer on the wheel even better.

## Special Feature
The device fits laptops up to 16 inches easily with the Wheel straight. If you are using even larger laptops, you can turn the wheel 90 degrees and let the laptop extend out to the left or right.
