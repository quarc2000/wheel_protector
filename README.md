# wheel_protector
A tool that during static tests protects the Scania Steering Wheel from a laptop or other equipment

Only use in a static environment.
Make sure there is no risk of detonating the airbag.
Make sure the vehicle is not moving.
Use at your own risk.

__Printing__
As the two pieces are different I strongly recommend a colour separation between left and righ. I have standardised white to the left, and any other colour on the right.
I have mostly used PLA when printing, but if you are going to leave them in the cab they might quickly degrade because of the temperature, so PETG or even mor robust materials shold be considered.
There is very little load on the pieces, so 2-3 walls and 10-20 % infill shold be enough in most cases, but depends on how you will be carrying them. I have been using them also as reflexes, 
using reflective string and reflexes on the sides, then having ot connected to by mag with a carbine. But even then, no breaks, I think temperature is the buggest challenge.
It has of course been designed not to require any supports, making it easy to use any material (overhangs are insignificant.

__Mounting__
The design is made to keep the two pieces together using a string. Earlier versions used glue, but to simplify production of several that was modified to instead using a separate lock piece
to long the string in. If you are using a thin string, you put a knot at the end and put then into the void before closing the slot with the locking piece, if you have a thicker string, you just melt the end a bit.
For low volumes you could of course still use a drop of superglue in the void before closing the locking piece.
